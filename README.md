#_Neritic Game_
We don't even have a name yet, move along.  
So far all the "game" does is draw a 640x480 window with white.

## Dependencies
* Python 2
* SFML 2

## Building and Installing
`python setup.py build`  
`python setup.py install`

## Notes
_Test-Game_ and _neritic_game.test_ are both temporary until the engine gets settled.  
They're meant to hold hackish and broken code to stand-in for finalized systems and to combine current systems in a hackish manner.
